This is the README file for the HP Smart Agent Code

Synopsis

This directory contains the files for the Python-based HPCS Red Dwarf Smart Agent. The ideas for this 
agent are inspired by the C++ Sneaky Pete agent. This smart agent has the purpose of communicating 
with RabbitMQ and acting accordingly on messages originating from the Red Dwarf API once an instance 
is launched and responding accordingly with the status of the result of those actions.

Files

smartagent.py

This file is the primary daemon code that runs the tasks of the smart agent. It can simply be started
by the following:

$PATH_TO_REDDWARF/smartagent/smartagent.py start

Stopped by:

$PATH_TO_REDDWARF/smartagent/smartagent.py stop

Restart:

$PATH_TO_REDDWARF/smartagent/smartagent.py restart 

As well, for this script to start upon system restart, there is an init script in the 
"startup" sudirectory, interestingly named "smartagent" that when set up (see README 
in that directory) will result in the smart agent starting on system boot. 


Prerequisites

Currently (subject to change)

useradd -d /home/nova -m -g mysql -s /bin/bash nova

sudo su - nova
mkdir ~/logs
mkdri ~/lock

command_handler.py

This file contains the method dispatch per message received from RabbitMQ

check_mysql_status.py

This file contains the implementation of checking whether MySQL is up and running
without having to connect via libmysql to the MySQL server and having to authenticate. It 
does so by connecting directly via the socket and recieving the first 4096 bytes of the
response and parsing that response for the MySQL version (5.N.N)
