This directory contains files required for the instance to boot propertly, 
the agent start up, and for the nova user to be able to start and stop 
MySQL.

Installation

The init scripts smart_agent and disk_prep need to be init.d directory and
you then need to make sure they run in the proper startup sequence. The 
following commands will ensure this

cp smart_agent disk_prep /etc/init.d
update-rc.d disk_prep defaults 85
update-rc.d smart_agent defaults 90

Then remove the mysql init script. The reason for this is to use upstart
as it will allow nova user to sudo to run this command to 
start, stop or restart MySQL.
 
update-rc.d -f mysql remove
rm /etc/init.d/mysql
cp mysql.conf /etc/init
